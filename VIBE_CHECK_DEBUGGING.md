# Vibe Check Loading Issues - Debugging Guide

## Issues Identified

### 1. **RLS (Row Level Security) Policy Restriction**

- **Problem**: The current RLS policy only allows users to view their own vibe checks
- **Impact**: When viewing a friend's profile, the app tries to fetch their vibe checks but fails due to RLS restrictions
- **Solution**: Updated ProfileScreen to only fetch vibe checks for own profile

### 2. **Missing Error Handling**

- **Problem**: The app doesn't properly handle cases where vibe checks can't be fetched
- **Impact**: Users see loading states indefinitely or empty screens
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and debugging logs

### 3. **Potential Authentication Issues**

- **Problem**: Supabase client might not be properly authenticated on iOS devices
- **Impact**: API calls fail silently
- **Solution**: Added authentication checks and better client configuration

## Changes Made

### ProfileScreen.tsx

- Added check to only fetch vibe checks for own profile (due to RLS restrictions)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fixed tailwind config access issues
- Added proper error handling

### vibeCheckService.ts

- Added authentication validation before making requests
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Added checks for Supabase client initialization
- Added user ID validation for RLS compliance

### supabase.ts

- Added better client configuration with auth options
- Added connection testing on initialization
- Added debug logging for configuration

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables

```bash
# Make sure these are set in your .env file
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Check Console Logs

Look for these log messages:

- `ðŸ”§ Supabase configuration:` - Should show "Present" for both URL and Key
- `âœ… Supabase client initialized successfully` - Should appear on app start
- `âœ… Authenticated user: [user_id]` - Should show when fetching vibe checks
- `âœ… Successfully fetched X vibe checks` - Should show the number of vibe checks found

### 3. Test on Different Devices

- **Simulator**: Should work as before
- **iOS Device**: Check if authentication is working properly
- **Android Device**: Verify consistent behavior

## RLS Policy Analysis

Current policy in `database/vibe_check_feedback.sql`:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own feedback" ON vibe_check_feedback
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This policy means:

- Users can only see their own vibe checks
- When viewing a friend's profile, the app cannot fetch their vibe checks
- This is the correct behavior for privacy

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. For Friend Profiles - RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Use Option B: Modify the existing RLS policy**

This is the recommended approach because it:

- Maintains data consistency (single table)
- Requires minimal code changes
- Provides better performance
- Is more flexible for future features

**Implementation:**

1. Run the migration in `database/vibe_check_feedback_friends_policy.sql`
2. The ProfileScreen has been updated to fetch vibe checks for any user
3. RLS policy will automatically handle permissions

**Alternative Option A: Create a public vibe checks table**

```sql
-- Create a separate table for public vibe checks
CREATE TABLE public_vibe_checks (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    short_summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    detailed_report TEXT NOT NULL,
    source_url TEXT,
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    request_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

-- Allow users to view public vibe checks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public vibe checks" ON public_vibe_checks
    FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);
```

**Why Option B is better:**

- âœ… Single source of truth for vibe checks
- âœ… No data duplication or sync issues
- âœ… Simpler queries and better performance
- âœ… Easier to maintain and extend
- âœ… Minimal code changes required

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Own Profile**: Vibe checks should load normally
2. **Friend Profile**: Vibe checks section should be empty (due to RLS)
3. **Console Logs**: Should show detailed debugging information
4. **Error Handling**: Should gracefully handle failures

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test Supabase connection manually
4. Check if the user is properly authenticated
5. Verify the vibe_check_feedback table exists and has data
