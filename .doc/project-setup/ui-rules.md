# **SnapConnect \- UI & Design Principles**

Theme: Modern Minimalist  
Platform: Mobile Only  
This document outlines the core UI/UX principles that guide the design and development of SnapConnect. These rules ensure a cohesive, intuitive, and high-performance user experience.

### **1\. The Interface is a Lens**

The primary function of the UI is to act as a clear, unobtrusive layer over the user's world and content.

- **Content, Not Chrome:** The user's photos, videos, and friends' content are the most important elements on the screen. UI elements (buttons, menus, bars) must be secondary.
- **Minimalism in the Camera View:** The default Camera screen should have the absolute minimum UI required for core actions (capture, switch camera, access chats/stories). All other options should be a single, intuitive gesture away.
- **Contextual Controls:** Display controls only when they are relevant. For example, editing tools appear only _after_ a snap has been taken.

### **2\. Speed and Fluidity are Paramount**

The application must feel instantaneous. Design choices should prioritize performance and responsiveness.

- **Gesture-Driven Navigation:** The core navigation between the main sections (Chat, Camera, Stories) will be handled by horizontal swipes. This is faster and more fluid than tapping on a navigation bar.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Every tap and gesture must have immediate visual feedback (e.g., a button state change, a screen transition). There should be no perceptible lag.
- **Flat Architecture:** Avoid deep, nested menus. Users should be able to access any primary feature within one or two taps/swipes from the main camera screen.

### **3\. Encourage Ephemeral Creation**

The design language should constantly reinforce the "in-the-moment," temporary nature of the content.

- **Prioritize the Camera:** The app opens directly to the camera, encouraging creation over consumption.
- **Transitional UI:** Use fluid animations for sending and receiving snaps. The UI should feel alive and dynamic, not static and archival.
- **Clear, Unambiguous Icons:** Icons should be universally understood to reduce cognitive load. A paper plane for 'send', a circle for 'record', 'X' for 'close'.

### **4\. Consistency is Key**

A consistent design language makes the app predictable and easy to learn.

- **Defined Spacing and Sizing:** All elements will adhere to the spacing and sizing scale defined in theme-rules.md. This creates a harmonious and visually balanced layout.
- **Consistent Component Design:** A button, input field, or list item should look and behave the same way everywhere in the app.
- **Typography Hierarchy:** A clear typographic scale (as defined in theme-rules.md) will be used to differentiate titles, subtitles, body text, and captions, guiding the user's eye through the interface.
