Project Overview

This 7-day project challenges you to build a fully functional Snapchat clone called SnapConnect, then enhance it with cutting-edge RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities that surpass existing social platforms. Note we are only creating the mobile app version of this app. You'll leverage modern AI development tools and implement sophisticated content generation and personalization systems throughout the entire user experience.

Phase 1: Core Clone

Build a complete ephemeral messaging platform with essential features:

Real-time photo/video sharing with disappearing messages

Simple AR filters and camera effects

User authentication and friend management

Stories and group messaging functionality

Core social features matching Snapchat's core experience

Phase 2: RAG Enhancement

Transform your clone by integrating advanced RAG capabilities tailored to your chosen user niche:

Personalized content generation based on user interests and history

Intelligent caption and story suggestions using RAG

Context-aware friend and content recommendations

AI-generated content ideas and prompts

Ultimate Goal: Create a better version of Snapchat built with RAG-first principles, demonstrating how retrieval-augmented generation can revolutionize content creation and personalization beyond what traditional platforms offer.
